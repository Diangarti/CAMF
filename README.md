Counter Anti-Forensic of Median Filtered Images

In this work we propose a robust counter method of antiforensic
median filter (MF) detector based on a Residual Dense
Neural Network. To extract the forensic residual features of
median filtered image, we employ a Median Filter Residual
(MFR) in the first layer of the network. The Residual Dense Block (RDB) is the
building block of our network that allows the local and global
residual learning of features hierarchically so as to extract
robust features for classification. Our counter anti-forensic
method,  is robust in two ways: 1)
is effective in identifying median filtered operations in small
size JPEG compressed images and 2) is highly efficient in
identifying median filtered images under various anti-forensic
attacks. The advantage of detecting median
filtering operation on small size images with high accuracy is
important because it can be helpful when localizing manipulated
regions for a more practical scenario.
